 The API key from your nuget.org account. It’s tied to your nuget.org user and you paste that key into the GitHub repository secrets area under the name NUGET_API_KEY. The GitHub Actions workflow reads that secret and uses it to authenticate dotnet nuget push.
Step-by-step: get a NuGet API key
1.	On nuget.org sign in.
2.	Click your profile (top-right) → “API Keys”.
3.	Click “Create” (or view an existing key). When creating:
•	Give it a descriptive name (e.g., GitHub Actions - BugViewer).
•	Choose scope:
•	Restrict to specific package ID(s) if you want least privilege (recommended). You can enter BugViewer or a prefix depending on naming.
•	Or choose “All packages” if you need broader scope.
•	Optionally set expiration.
4.	Create the key and copy the generated value now (you won’t be able to view it again).
Notes about scope
•	The key is tied to your nuget.org account (not the repo). You do NOT need to create a package on nuget.org first — you can create the key and then push packages later.
•	Prefer restricting the key to the package ID(s) you will publish so a leak can’t publish other packages.
Add the key to GitHub repository secrets
1.	In GitHub go to the repository → Settings → “Secrets and variables” → “Actions”.
2.	Click “New repository secret”.
3.	Name it exactly NUGET_API_KEY.
4.	Paste the API key value from nuget.org and save.
How the workflow uses it
•	Your workflow reads ${{ secrets.NUGET_API_KEY }} and passes it to dotnet nuget push via an environment variable or command line. That is already present in your nuget.yml.
How to test
•	Locally: run
•	dotnet pack ./BugViewer/BugViewer.csproj -c Release -o ./packages
•	dotnet nuget push ./packages/*.nupkg -k <YOUR_API_KEY> -s https://api.nuget.org/v3/index.json
•	In GitHub: run the NuGet Generation workflow manually (Actions → NuGet Generation → Run workflow) or create a release to trigger it. Check the Actions run logs for the dotnet nuget push step to confirm success.
Security & maintenance
•	Do not commit the API key into source code.
•	Rotate/regenerate the key if it’s leaked or when someone leaves the team.
•	You can revoke a key on nuget.org anytime.
